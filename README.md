Tired of learning the hard way? Pro-Tip Pal has your back! This mod is like your friendly know-it-all gaming buddy who’s always ready to share a tip or trick—whether you asked for it or not. From survival secrets to hidden features, Pro-Tip Pal delivers bite-sized advice in chat while you play.

Featuring over 200 unique tips like:

"Pro Tip: Skeletons always miss their first arrow if you stand still... Just kidding, RUN!"
"Pro Tip: Mine dirt near diamonds for a chance to find ancient potatoes. (Okay, maybe not ancient, but dirt hides treasures!)"
"Pro Tip: Remember, creepers don’t knock—so don’t mine at night!"
Customize when and how tips appear using /protip settings or turn them into a challenge mode with "Troll Tips" (e.g., "Pro Tip: Lava makes a great swimming pool!").
